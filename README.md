### Hi there, I'm Joseph ðŸ‘‹

I am a Tester from Scotland.  I've been working in IT for over 20 years.  
Recently (well - the last 4/5 years) I've been moving into the world of automation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing - no personal projects on the go just now.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift (when my mac comes back from repair!!!) / CSS / Javascript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter @_MEJadams
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / Him
